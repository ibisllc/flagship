# Flagship — orientation for Claude Code

Personal-cloud ecosystem. The phone is the trust root; users run their own server on commodity hardware at home; **TLS terminates on the user's box** so flagship.services literally cannot read user content. Verified end-to-end in production with a real green padlock as of 2026-05-05.

**This file is the single in-repo source of truth for current status and open work** — see "Current status & open work" at the bottom; update that section as work lands rather than starting new `docs/*handoff*.md` files. If you have access to agent memory, `project_overview.md` is a deeper architectural briefing (`final_architecture_2026_05_05.md` has the gory detail). Dated session handoffs and completed launch trackers are frozen in `docs/archive/` (history only).

## What's where

```
apps/com/                  Cloudflare Worker — flagshipserver.com (identity + state) + web.flagshipserver.com (webapp host-rewrite)
apps/web/                  Fly app — flagship.services (stateless data plane) + the webapp static surface
apps/web/public/           Static assets served by the Worker's [assets] binding
   ready/                  /ready/ — after an order: copy/download the recipe + get the burner (replaced the old /build/ paste-a-code page; /build/iso/ stays as the R2 ISO-stream backend)
   dev/create-server       /dev/create-server — phone simulator
   status/                 /status/ — live health dashboard
   security/               disclosure.html, report.html
   webapp/                 PWA source (served at root on web.flagshipserver.com)
apps/mobile/               iOS Swift + Android Kotlin clients — substantial code; not yet on TestFlight/Play

packages/protocol/         Canonical-bytes + Ed25519 sign/verify for every signed message
packages/storage/          Storage interfaces + InMemory + D1 adapters + SQL migrations
packages/control-plane/    Pure runtime-agnostic handlers (used by Worker AND Fastify)
packages/server-daemon/    PRODUCTION daemon entry (acme, tunnel client, service runner, lease store, browser bundle)
packages/hello-daemon/     Minimal demo daemon — kept around for chain smoke-testing only
packages/iso-personalizer/ Trailer format (build/parse/personalize-stream)
packages/installer-apkovl/ Builds the apkovl tarball baked into the Alpine ISO
packages/tunnel-protocol/  Frame format for the tunnel + SNI parser
packages/services-zone/    `<server>.<user>.flagship.services` validation + DNS publisher
packages/bootkey-builder/  Caddyfile + per-server FQDN/SAN helpers
packages/llm-providers/    BYOK provider adapters

installer/                 Public install scripts the apkovl curls at boot
   install.sh              First-boot installer: LUKS + git clone + register
   boot-stage.sh           Steady-state boot: contact .services for unlock-key

Dockerfile                 Builds the Fly app image
fly.toml                   :443 raw-TCP (SNI passthrough) + :8443 TLS-term (API + tunnel hub)
```

## Architecture in one sentence

**`.com` (Worker + D1 + R2)** owns identity & persistent state. **`.services` (single Fly app)** is a stateless pipe: SNI passthrough on :443 + tunnel-hub WebSocket on :8443. **The user's daemon** runs ACME locally (TLS-ALPN-01 over the same passthrough chain), holds the Let's Encrypt cert, and serves services. **Routing-Control-Key (RCK)** is a phone-held primitive that decouples "who can claim a subdomain's traffic" from "which server is currently handling it" — enables failover/migration/delegation.

## Live URLs

- `https://flagshipserver.com/` — landing
- `https://flagshipserver.com/ready/` — after an order: copy/download the recipe + get the burner
- `https://flagshipserver.com/dev/create-server` — phone simulator (mints build codes)
- `https://flagshipserver.com/status/` — live health
- `https://flagshipserver.com/api/health` — JSON health
- `https://flagship.services/api/health` — direct Fly health
- `https://<server>.<user>.flagship.services/` — user content (after a real install)

## Common operations

```sh
# Tests
npx vitest run                                  # everything (~30s)
npx tsc -b                                      # typecheck the whole tree

# Deploy
cd apps/com && npx wrangler deploy              # Worker
export PATH="$HOME/.fly/bin:$PATH"
flyctl deploy --remote-only --strategy=immediate --yes -a flagship-services

# D1 schema migrations
cd apps/com && npx wrangler d1 execute flagship-state \
    --file=../../packages/storage/migrations/0003_install_events.sql --remote

# Smoke a fresh build chain
# 1. Open https://flagshipserver.com/dev/create-server in a browser
# 2. Mint an order; collect the recipe from https://flagshipserver.com/ready/
# 3. Run packages/hello-daemon with the printed creds
# 4. curl https://<assigned-subdomain>/   (real green padlock)
```

## Conventions

- **No `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer on commits** — user preference.
- BUSL-1.1 license. Change Date 2030-05-03 → Apache 2.0.
- Imperative commit subjects. Body explains *why*, not *what*.
- TypeScript ESM, strict mode, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`.
- Tests live next to packages: `packages/<pkg>/tests/`.
- Canonical-bytes use `|` separator and `flagship/<purpose>/v1` tag prefix.
- No comments unless the *why* is non-obvious; never explain *what*.
- **Unlaunched features live entirely on their own branch; `main` ships clean.**
  Every not-yet-launched feature — site literature, app code (iOS/Android/
  webapp), backend logic, AND tests — lives ONLY on its feature branch, so
  `main` "doesn't think of" it at all. Current branches: **`feat/marketplace`**
  (the marketplace) and **`feat/retail`** (getting the app working with
  retail / NFC boxes). **No marketplace/retail code may sit on `main` until
  that feature launches** — branching IS the gate, there is NO gating/flag code
  in `main`.
  - **`alpine` is a *parked* branch, not a feature-to-launch.** It holds the
    full Alpine bare-metal installer path (ISO builder + apkovl + installer-tiny
    + the burner Quick/trailer flow + `/api/personalize-iso`) that `main` shed
    when we went Debian-only. Same mechanics (it's `main` + the Alpine delta,
    built by reverting the removal commits — `git diff <pre-extraction> alpine`
    was empty = lossless), but its purpose is *revival* if/when the Alpine
    initramfs USB-enumeration blocker is solved, not merging into a launch.
  - **Each branch = `main` + exactly one feature.** A branch is built so its
    diff against `main` is *only* that feature (so merging it ships the
    feature). Branches are **independent of each other** — you can check out one
    at a time to work on it; neither carries the other's code.
  - **Dependencies go through git, not entanglement.** If a feature ever
    depends on another, branch it OFF that feature's branch — never co-mingle
    two features on one branch.
  - **Extraction/reorg is forward-only** (no history rewrite on `main`) and
    **lossless** — nothing in features/UX/code/tests is lost, only relocated;
    anything removed from `main` exists on the feature branch.
  - **Workspace artifacts stay on `main`, never extracted:** DB migrations +
    repo-root `docs/*` design specs. Neither ships to users or the website —
    they're dev scaffolding. A feature-only table in prod (`marketplace_listings`,
    `box_serials`) is fine: develop the feature by checking out its branch and
    running against the live table. Only *application* code is extracted.
  - **At commit time, weigh impact on the feature branches** — they don't
    auto-receive `main`'s commits, so a `main`-only fix to shared code needs
    cherry-picking forward when a branch is integrated.

### Live in production
- **Per-user TLS** — one Let's Encrypt cert per user, SANs `[<user>, *.<user>]`, real green padlock (per-box → per-user cutover verified live 2026-06-02). ACME runs on the user's daemon over SNI passthrough; `.services` stays content-blind. Wildcard SANs via DNS-01.
- Auto-unlock-lease (one-shot + long-lived) with silent renewer; WebAuthn-PRF cloud recovery; Web Push (RFC 8291 encrypted payloads); `/consume` → push.
- **Cert model** (iOS + web + Android): creation is a binary — *managed* (your devices renew it, default) vs *autonomous* (the box self-renews); renewal window is an account-wide "Certificate validity" setting (presets 7/30/90, default 30).
- **Recovery Phase B backend** deployed — single-device re-pair grace 7d→3d; the wrapped-UMK fetch returns `registeredIrkPubHex` for rotation detection.
- Brand/teal migration complete (rounded-square-containing-a-circle mark; the flag-on-mast pennant is **retired — do not reintroduce**). `/og` social card, `/ready` page, webapp no-server empty states, iOS Apps→Services rename + persistent pending servers.
- **All prod users wiped 2026-06-02** for a clean pre-release slate (`marketplace_listings` preserved).

Gates (2026-06-03): web 978 · com+control-plane 1108 · iOS 755 XCTests · `npx tsc -b` clean. `npx vitest run` ~30s. Workspace deps: `npm install` + `npx tsc -b`.

### Open work

**Hardware / boot — Debian-only now; getting a box to boot is the gate:**
> **Decision (2026-06-08): Debian is the sole shipping path; Alpine is parked on the `alpine` branch.** Alpine's initramfs wouldn't enumerate USB on real metal ("mounting boot media failed"), and the fix was hardware-iteration-gated + speculative; Debian-installer already solves the hard UEFI-NVRAM-rejection problem and its whole downstream (bootstrap, boot-stage, LUKS, systemd, register) is shared + Debian-ready. `main` is now Alpine-free + green (tsc · vitest 4356 · iOS 728 · Android · burner swift 72 / pytest 62; Windows burner via its own CI). Remaining work is the **Debian-quick + manifest + phone-home plan** (below), then a live e2e burn.
1. **Burner "Simple" = cache Debian + burn (Phase 2).** Quick mode is currently removed (it was the Alpine path); re-add a Debian-native Simple mode: a **manifest-driven** base cache (`POST /api/iso-manifest` → server returns `{download:{url,sha256,…}}` or `null`; burner is a dumb executor — downloads + sha-verifies when ordered, shows the URL under the progress bar, logs path+sha on every boot and after each download). Advanced (user-supplied ISO) stays. Mirror across mac/linux/windows.
2. **`/api/iso-manifest` backend.** New unauthenticated endpoint + a Worker-side config holding the blessed Debian manifest (the fleet lever: hold old releases or fast-track by whether a `download` is emitted). Short `docs/iso-manifest.md` spec.
3. **Simplify the website (Phase 3)** — `/ready` = copy/download the recipe + get the burner; drop the Alpine "Recommended" framing; advanced/ISO lives only in the burner, not the site.
4. **Earliest phone-home (Phase 4)** — port the netboot `preseed/early_command` beacon to the burner preseed (`preseed.ts` + Swift `UserData`): Beacon A in `early_command` (pre-boot, busybox-wget, best-effort) + Beacon B at top of `late_command` (guaranteed network), both keyed by `authCode.serial` → the `/api/order/:serial/status` timeline.
5. **Verify Debian-preseed reliability** — cmdline injection (`Remaster.swift`/`remasterIso.ts` grub+isolinux patch) was per-ISO flaky earlier; add real-Debian-ISO tests, then a burned box must register + get a cert.

*Owner-side for the live e2e: host the pinned Debian netinst (R2 or CDN — the manifest endpoint decides per-call; pin the sha to Debian's signed SHA256SUMS for verifiability), seed the manifest config, rebuild + re-sign the Mac burner, run the wipe, then create-account → recipe → burn → boot → padlock.*

**App / recovery:**
5. **Recovery Phase B re-pair branch (iOS, on-device validation).** Wire `recoveredKeyMatchesRegistered` into post-recovery completion: recovered IRK == registered → instant pair (Phase A); != → re-pair with `oldIrkPub = registeredIrkPubHex` + 3d grace; `KeyfileImportViewModel` instant skip-grace. Backend already deployed.
6. **iOS owner-device confirmations** (from 2026-06-02, never confirmed on device): cross-device-QR recovery fix (`f4593a3`); Passwords-app icon flips to the teal ring; a real burn → box registers → green padlock.
7. **iOS diagnostics:** jetsam memory crash after ~14 min (use the Memory Graph Debugger; note which screen grows); input-field delay on "I already have an account" (confirm with a Release/Profile build).

**Ship / launch (owner-side, mostly):**
8. **Stores.** iOS TestFlight (Associated Domains capability, Xcode Archive + ASC upload, metadata, 5 external testers); Android Play (signed AAB via `./gradlew :app:bundleRelease`, internal track, 5 testers). Neither app is on a store yet, so push / Live-Activity timelines can't be received on a real device.
9. **Marketplace security scanner** — `marketplace_listings.scan_grade` ships NULL; needs the Trivy + custom-checks service that posts grade + R2 report. MVP gate before public marketplace.
10. **v1-alpha live exercises** (multi-day, observational): recovery / rotation / update-pack over 7 days × 2 pods; peer-backup at scale; marketplace MVP; public disclosure + bounty path.
11. **Disarm the mass-wipe before real users.** `scripts/wipe-all-users-prerelease-2026-06-02.sql` is a single idempotent file that deletes every user + server. Fine for the pre-release slate, a footgun once we serve real accounts. Before GA: gate it (per-env confirmation token, prod row-count safety/dry-run, audit-logged admin-only path) or remove the blanket script from the deployable surface so no one can nuke prod in one command. Keep the wipe script's table list in sync with new migrations until then.

**NFC retail tier (post-v1; design in `docs/v1-operational-tasks.md § N`):** protocol + daemon state machine + cloud activation API are built & partly live; **C3 — iOS + Android NFC read flow** is the remaining agent-doable chunk. Hardware bring-up waits on the hardware-shipping business decision.
